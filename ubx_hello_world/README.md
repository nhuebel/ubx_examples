This is a simple hello world node that can be used to test various other blocks (e.g. schedulers, configurator, etc.).

==Usage==
Each `hello_world` block can be configured with a number (don't have to be unique). Then launch several of them, configure them, and see if the scheduler is triggering them correctly. See `usc`-file for an example.
